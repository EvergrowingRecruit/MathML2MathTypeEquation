## MathML2MathTypeEquation ##

This article is instructing to you how to use [MathType](https://www.dessci.com/en/reference/sdk/) to converting [MathML](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%A6%E7%BD%AE%E6%A0%87%E8%AF%AD%E8%A8%80) to mathtype equation and embedded in microsoft word document.

Recently, there is a demand which is requiring convert a great many mathml file into word,it is easy to implement using [Open-XML-SDK](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK) where the project in [https://github.com/scalad/MathML2Word](https://github.com/scalad/MathML2Word).But, all the matter is that it's not what I wanted,because bying way of Open-XML-XML's translater,the equation's type is the [OMML(Office Math Markup Language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_markup_language) ,and what's the OMML?

As we know,Microsoft Word included Equation Editor, a limited version of MathType, until 2007.These allow entering formulae using a [graphical user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface), and converting to standard markup languages such as MathML.With Microsoft's release of [Microsoft Office 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_2007) and the [Office Open XML file formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML_file_formats), they introduced a new equation editor which uses a new format, "Office Math Markup Language" (OMML). The lack of compatibility led some prestigious scientific journals to refuse to accept manuscripts which had been produced using Microsoft Office 2007.
